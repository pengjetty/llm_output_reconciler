# Build and Testing Instructions

## Build Commands
When making code changes, always run the build and test commands to ensure code quality. Figure out the build and test commands in each setup.

## Auto-Build After Code Changes
**MANDATORY**: After ANY code modification (edit, create, or delete files), IMMEDIATELY run the build command to catch compilation errors early and fix them immediately. This must be done for EVERY code change without exception.
