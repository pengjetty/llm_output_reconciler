# LLM Output Comparison Tool — Complete Requirements & Implementation

## Overview

This is a comprehensive web-based tool to compare outputs from various LLM models against a reference (golden copy). The application features advanced API key management, sophisticated test case creation, parallel model execution, visual diff highlighting, enterprise-grade storage management, and professional UI design using shadcn/ui components. The tool operates entirely client-side with robust error handling and data recovery mechanisms.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. API Key Management
- Users can input and save API keys for multiple LLM providers:
  - **OpenAI**: gpt-4.1, gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1-nano, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-3.5-turbo (+ deprecated legacy models)
  - **Anthropic**: claude-opus-4-20250514, claude-sonnet-4-20250514, claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219, claude-3-5-haiku-20241022 (+ deprecated legacy models)
  - **Google Gemini**: gemini-2.5-pro, gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-flash-lite (+ deprecated legacy models)
  - **xAI**: grok-3, grok-3-pro, grok-3-mini (+ deprecated legacy models)
- Each provider can have multiple models configured with individual selection.
- Users can enable/disable entire providers and individual models within each provider.
- **Individual Model Selection**: Users can selectively choose which specific models to run for each comparison, allowing granular control over testing scope.
- **Enhanced Model Information**: Detailed specifications displayed for each model including:
  - Input types supported (text, images, audio, video, PDF)
  - Output capabilities
  - Context window sizes (8k to 1M tokens)
  - Pricing per million tokens (input/output rates)
  - Optimized use cases and performance characteristics
  - Deprecated status with visual indicators

### 2. Prompt Input
- Accept both **text** and **image** as input.
  - For text: textarea input.
  - For image: file upload (PNG/JPG) or URL input.
- Allow multimodal models to process both inputs when supported.

### 3. Golden Copy and Output Comparison
- Users provide a **golden copy** (expected output).
- Each selected model generates a response.
- The tool compares the model output against the golden copy and:
  - Computes a **diff score** (e.g., Levenshtein distance, token diff %).
  - Displays side-by-side comparison with highlighted differences.

### 4. Local Result Storage
- All run data is stored **locally** using localStorage with advanced storage management.
- **Enhanced Storage Features**:
  - Automatic data backup and recovery
  - Storage quota management with progressive cleanup
  - Data export/import functionality
  - Storage debugging tools and health monitoring
- Each record includes:
  - Prompt input (text/image)
  - Golden copy
  - Model configurations
  - Model outputs
  - Diff scores
  - Timestamp
- **Storage Management**:
  - Automatic cleanup when storage quota is exceeded
  - Configurable data limits (history, tests, backups)
  - Fallback storage mechanisms
  - Detailed error reporting with storage diagnostics

### 5. Output Ranking
- Model results are automatically **sorted** by the fewest diffs.
- Optionally allow users to toggle between different diff metrics.

### 6. Prompt History and Rerun
- Save all previous prompts locally.
- Provide a UI to browse past prompts and outputs.
- Allow users to **rerun** past prompts against new or existing model configurations.

### 7. Test Case Management
- **Test Creation**: Create and manage test cases with unique names
- **Test Editor**: Advanced editing interface with explicit save/cancel functionality
- **Change Detection**: Visual indicators for unsaved changes with real-time feedback
- **Test Selection**: Visual selection with highlighting and active state indicators
- **CRUD Operations**: Complete Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality for test cases

### 8. Parallel Processing & Performance
- **Concurrent Execution**: Run multiple models simultaneously using Promise.all
- **Real-time Logging**: Activity logs with timestamps and color-coded severity levels
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual feedback during model execution
- **Timeout Management**: 30-second API timeouts with proper abort handling

### 9. Visual Comparison System
- **Word-level Diff Highlighting**: Advanced algorithm for highlighting differences
- **Performance Ranking**: Automatic sorting by diff scores with color-coded indicators
- **Expandable Results**: Collapsible result cards for detailed examination
- **Side-by-side Comparison**: Golden copy vs model output display
- **Best Match Identification**: Clear indication of top-performing models

- No server-side logic is required; this is a fully client-side tool (MVP).
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet screens.
- Handle model timeouts and failures gracefully with detailed error reporting.
- UI should be clean and developer-friendly (React + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui implementation).
- **Enhanced Error Handling**:

  - User-friendly error messages with actionable solutions
  - Automatic error recovery mechanisms
  - Storage quota management and cleanup
  - Emergency storage fallbacks with multiple recovery levels
- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Efficient storage management with size limits
  - Progressive data reduction for large datasets
  - Background cleanup of old data and backups
  - Parallel API execution for improved response times
- **Design System Requirements**:
  - Professional UI using shadcn/ui component library
